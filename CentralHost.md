# Central Host #

This is the host running the scospub infrastructure (together with a BOINC server installation).

In the initial ideas of the project,
it is assumed that only one such host is needed world-wide,
but there is nothing that forbids setting up several networks.

If the setting up is simple enough,
an Open Source project could have a setup of its own.
This would reduce some of the security problems by making it smaller,
in the same time, it is harder to use resources efficiently.
