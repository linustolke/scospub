#summary Use Cases

= Configure a project =

The Open Source Project Administrator
enters the web page of the system and configures the project.

The configuration includes:
  * Name of the project
  * Repository location
  * Selection of tools to run and if available, how they are to be configured.

= Set up a Check Host =

The Check Host Administrator does the following:
  # Install and configure the BOINC client.
  # Add the Central Host URL to the BOINC client as a project.
  # Optionally he can also select projects to run otherwise all projects are candidates.

If the Check Host Administrator no longer wants to use his host for this,
he detaches the project or uninstalls the BOINC client.

= Perform a static check =

The Check Host does this continously.
This is taken care of by the BOINC client and the application.
  # Download a work package.
  # Start the work package:
    # Download the appropriate tool (provided as a file from the Check Host)
    # Download the source to test (downloaded directly from the Open Source repository)
  # Run the tool
  # Upload the result.
  # The Central Host enters the result in a database.

= Examine the result =

A web page on the Central Host is shown with the result from the contents of the database.
