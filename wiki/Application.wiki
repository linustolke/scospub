#summary An overview of the design of the Application

= Application =

The Application is a BOINC application.
It is downloaded from the server and run on each CheckHost.

These could exist for several combinations of OS and CPU according to the BOINC
handling of different system types.

The requirements are:
  * Simple, straight-forward.
  * Linked with the BOINC library and implementing the BOINC API.

The first attempt was with running the wrapper application and just generating
a job.xml file containing commands.
This didn't work very well during the development of the other parts since a small error in the script made a command fail and then the wrapper restarted this command indefinately.
If there is some problem for the client, downloading from the repository or running the tool, it would be better if the client fails completely.
Another problem was that extra "tools" had to be distributed to start svn and java.

For this reason the next step would be to rewrite the application to a specific scospub application that solves this.
It knows the concept of repositories (subversion and whatever), starts the correct application and handles problems in a smart way.
It could also be easily augmented to do some basic security checks on the invoked programs.


In order not to affect the normal boinc handling of files,
the checked out files from the project's repository reside in a separate directory.
The layout is:
  /tmp/scospub/<project>/<configured path>

All instances of applications from the same <OSPROJ> share the same
directory so
some locking or other protection mechanism
is needed to allow
multiple boinc clients.
