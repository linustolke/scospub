  * OpenSourceDeveloper
  * CheckHost
  * OpenSourceProjectAdministrator
  * CentralHost

= Open Source Developer =

The developer is a person developing or looking at an Open Source Project.
He normally accesses the Result Pages at the Central Host to look at the result
of the static checks.

= Check Host =

A Check Host is one of the machines doing the work.
It is set up to run the BOINC client application that
regularly contacts the Central Host,
downloads work to be done,
do the work, and
upload the result.

= Open Source Project Administrator =

The Open Source Project Administrator uses
the configuration web pages on the Central Host
to specify where the project resides and what checks that
are relevant for that project.

= Central Host =

This is the host running the application (together with a BOINC server installation).
It is assumed that only one such host is needed world-wide but there is nothing
that forbids setting up several networks.
