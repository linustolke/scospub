#labels Phase-Requirements
= Set up a Check Host =

The Check Host Administrator does the following:
  # Install and configure the BOINC client.
  # Add the Central Host URL to the BOINC client as a project.
  # Optionally he can also select projects to run otherwise all projects are candidates.

If the Check Host Administrator no longer wants to use his host for this,
he detaches the project or uninstalls the BOINC client.
