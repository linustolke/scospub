#summary An overview of the design

= Parts =

There are two essential parts of the project,
differing in how they are deployed and because of that they have
completely separate requirements.
  * Server side tools
  * Application

== Server side tools ==

The Server side tools run, together with the BOINC server on the CentralHost to
  * Prepare work packages
  * Accept and take care of changes in configuration, new projects
  * Handle result and present it

Essentially these are deployed only once.

== Application ==

The Application is a BOINC application.
It is downloaded from the server and run on each ClientHost.

These could exist for several combinations of OS and CPU according to the BOINC
handling of different system types.

The requirements are:
  * Simple, straight-forward.
  * Linked with the BOINC library and implementing the BOINC API.

= Other ideas =

Since we are to use a lot of exterior tools to do this and these tool
do probably not fit with the BOINC API save and restore state and 
freeze execution,
we should strive to create as small work packages as possible.
We could explore having Job Control to allow pausing and restarting jobs
even though it is a rather clumsy way of doing it.
