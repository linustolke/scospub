#summary An overview of the design

= Parts =

There are two essential parts of the project,
differing in how they are deployed and because of that they have
completely separate requirements.
  * Server side tools
  * Application

== Server side tools ==

The Server side tools run, together with the BOINC server on the CentralHost to
  * Prepare work packages
  * Accept and take care of changes in configuration, new projects
  * Handle result from application
  * Present the result
  * Do configuration of projects

Essentially these are deployed only once.

The presentation of results and the configuration of projects uses
the boinc server web pages.
Including:
  * Base url
  * Web server configuration
  * php include files
  * Database (new tables for the scospub-level results)

The presentation of results is in the html/scospres
both in the scospub project and in the installed
boinc server web pages.
The project configuration files are in html/scosconf.

== Application ==

The Application is a BOINC application.
It is downloaded from the server and run on each ClientHost.

These could exist for several combinations of OS and CPU according to the BOINC
handling of different system types.

The requirements are:
  * Simple, straight-forward.
  * Linked with the BOINC library and implementing the BOINC API.

= Other ideas =

The tool wrapper, from boinc_samples, handles a list of commands,
saving and restoring state between them, and job control.
That would be a good starting point since
we are to use a lot of exterior tools.

We should strive to create as small work packages as possible.
