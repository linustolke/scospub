= Prerequisites =

Sofar no prerequisites except the ones already used by boinc are identified.

= Notes =

Linus is working on a debian host so there might be debian-specific stuff
in the project. If you find anything, lets fix it.

== Notes on configuring BOINC ==

locality_scheduling is a good idea to enable for the project.
The big files would then be the static check tools.

= Downloads =

There are no provided downloads. You need to work from the repository.
