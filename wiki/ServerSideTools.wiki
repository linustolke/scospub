#summary An overview of the design of the Server Side Tools

= Server side tools =

The Server side tools run, together with the BOINC server on the CentralHost to
  * Prepare work packages
  * Accept and take care of changes in configuration, new [OpenSourceProject]s
  * Handle result from application
  * Present the result
  * Do configuration of an OpenSourceProject

Essentially these are deployed only once.

The presentation of results and the configuration of projects uses
the boinc server web pages.
Including:
  * Base url
  * Web server configuration
  * php include files
  * Database (new tables for the scospub-level results)

The presentation of results is in the html/scospres
both in the scospub project and in the installed
boinc server web pages.
It is /scospres in the URL.

The project configuration files are in html/scosconf.
/scosconf in the URL.


== The database ==

=== Table scos_project: Project information ===
One line per project.
Active controls if the project should be built or not.

Project 1 is a dummy template project.

=== Table scos_tool: References to tools ===
Immutable fields:
  Connection to project,
  Toolname,
  Config.
Active=true signify the current configuration for a project.
Active=false signify historic information only available for reference.

Templates for allowed tools are entered with connection to project as 1.
Active then means available or not.

=== Table scos_source: References to source tree paths ===
All fields immutable except active.
Active=true signify the current configuration for a project.
Active=false signify historic information only available for reference.

=== Table scos_result ===
One row for each reported result.
Each result references a tool (active or passive).

Each result references one or more sources tree paths and contains their
version/date using a scos_result_source_reference table.
